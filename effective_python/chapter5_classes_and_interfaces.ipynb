    "- Avoid making dictionaries with values that are dictionaries, long tuples, or complex nesting of other built-in types.\n",
    "- Use `namedtuple` for lightweight, immutable data containers before you need the flexibility of a full class.\n",
    "- Move your bookkeeping code to using multiple classes when your internal state dictionaries get complicated.\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "We want to record the grades of a set of students whose names aren't known in advance. A class can hold the names in a dictionary instead of using a predefined attribute for each student."

    "#### Refactoring to Classes\n",
    "We can start moving to classes at the bottom of the dependency tree: a single grade. A class seems too heavyweight for such a simple information. A `tuple` though, seems appropriate because grades are immutable. The problem with that is that `tuple` instances are positional. For example, if we want to associate more information with grade than its weight, such as a set of notes from the teacher, we need to rewrite every usage of the two-tuple to be aware that there are now three items present instead of two. \n",
