The database has a schema set already. The code that uses objexts corresponding to those records must also know what the database looks like. However, in Python, the code that connects Python objects to the database doesn't need to explicitly specify the schema of the records; it can be generic. How? Certainly not with plain instance attributes, `@property` methods, and descriptors can't do this because they all need to be defined in advance.   \n",

The next time the user accesses a property, we want to know whether the corresponding record in the database is still valid and whether the transaction is still open. The `__getattr__` won't allow for this reliably because it will use the object's instance dictionary as the fast path for existing attributes. Another hook called `__getattributes__` can do this. This special method is called every time an attribute is accessed on an object, even in the cases where it does existin the attribute dictionary.
