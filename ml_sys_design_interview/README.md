  This folder contains my notes from each chapter of the Machine Learning System Design Interview book by Ali Aminian and Alex Xu. Every chapter covers a specific machine learning system and how to cover all the components from defining the objective to deployment, monitoring and metrics.   
  All the images are from the book.    
  This summary includes the concepts that I found interesting and is by no means comprehensive.
